Verse1:

The only way to make it happen
taking the strain out of control
Ignite the brightness in every shadow Breathless and tired, seeking hope I can’t reach

Crying  the power we've lost inside Shouting and howling to bring back the past Bring back my life, bring back my light

We will soon be taken out of the dark We will soon be revealed by the spark The only way, the only path, is…
Chorus1:
Evolution needs Revolution
Verse2:
Well, anyone see what we’ve become?
Well, take a look at what we’ve done Always waking, restless at night Oh, I see me blind, became so blind
Chorus2:
Evolution needs Revolution
Bridge:
Now that all is over 
I’m looking for a second chance 
Nothing seems to happen 
I have to make it real 
Thru darkness I’ve find the path, the truth 
I won’t ever be ashamed 
for what I’ve done

Evolution’s call Revolution
I am the evolution I am the revolution
