I’m a preacher, a leacher, 
A savior  
Your father, your brother, 
your sister 
I’m a sinner, a killer, a lier
Coming closer, Closer, closer 
Chorus2:
I’m a  vampire, your desire  
the vampire you need
vampire desire Vampire
Verse2:
I will wet, All your dreams, 
Time carved scars, on my neck, 
on my hands, Time spill tears 
on my life, The poison injected in my veins fuck my brains I’m stil 
alive
*
More vivid, than ever  
Can I stand all those light,, Will the strength in my fists.
Will my tears become red, Whole blood flows on my tongue  
The power of my eyes, The fire in my words
Chorus2:
Vampire empire, We’re all vampires, Were all bloody vampires 
To fulfill our desire 
Forever forever forever 
*
forever stay away from the light
I will forever remain in the night
