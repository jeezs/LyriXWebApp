Can you hear the ragged
Can't you see the wreck
Can you be heard
Revive the hope,
Ignite the flame
*
Make it shine anew
Step out of the shadows
Rise up to the sky
It’s our turn
It’s our chance to
Turn the pages, write our rights
Chorus:
Change, change, change
change the word, will change the world
*
Change, change, change
change the word, will change the world
Verse2:
Above your screams
Finally heard the truth
*
Behind our rage
Hiddenin your hate
*
Time to start believein you
Changes finally coming
World in your hands, dreams in sight
Burring the past chapter of your life
Chorus2:
Change, change, change
change the word, will change the world
Ending:
Speak the words, and change the world
