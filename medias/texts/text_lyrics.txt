Crimson rivers
Ghosts that wail
Cursed earth
Nightmares prevail

bad beat hearted bad thought minded
desperate from the path
no chance from the past
will the future hold
will I find some life inside


bad beat hearted bad thought minded
desperate from the path
no chance from the past
will the future hold
will our deadly hope
will I find some life inside
will my mind recover the light

will my mind recover the light


bad beat hearted bad thought minded
desperate from the path
no chance from the past
will the future hold
will our deadly hope
will I find some life inside
will my mind recover the light


bad beat hearted bad thought minded
desperate from the path
no chance from the past
will the future hold, will our deadly hope
will I find some life inside
