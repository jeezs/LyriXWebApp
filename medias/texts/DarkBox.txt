Socials tell me to 
close my mind
close my ears 
close my eyes 
Swallow this and dive inside 
dive inside
dive inside
dive inside

 The  darkbox...
Verse:
Do you really wanna to be scared  
No real fun will begin 
Stay away of what is there
*
Open your eyes 
Open wide, 
Can't you see it'a trap
The coffin for you mind
*
The darkbox
Chorus:
Ghost box, don't get inside this dark box  
No satisfaction out of the box  
*
Ghost box, stay away from this dark box  
Destroy this fuckin Pandora Box  
*
Ghost box, don't get inside this dark box  
No satisfaction out of the box
Smash the nightmare Box
