We make money from your body, lies with your smiles
Build their empire with your scars   
Swallow your mind

Put your smile online, 
Smile to the camera, 
Smile for the dollars,

We all know it's all fake, 
Your smile is fake
Your face is fake, 
Your body is fake
Fake, fake, fake
Chorus2:
We'll take money off your body
Dollars from your scars
Build an empire with our lies
Pure some tears on your smile

Smile smile 
How can you stay alive 
buried in digital mud, 
A bath of acid bits?
Look at what you've done to yourself
You are so socially trapped
Put your best smile on your tears
You can now spit your pics on everyone
You have to look so good

Fake, fake, fake,fake,fake... Fuck!
You're fucked, You're fucked, You're fucked 
*
Fake, fake, fake,fake,fake... Fuck!
You're fucked, You're fucked, You're fucked

My cutest puppet
