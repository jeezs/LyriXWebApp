Verse:
Searching your hands lush by the rain
Water drops melted with tears
Fall on my face, onto my lips

Chorus:
after the storm.
Will I still here the cries
after the rain
Will you remember our names?
after the tears
after the war

Verse2:
Hidden in our own pain,
Screaming and praying for mercy
Wanna burn those pictures.
Erase the screams
Help help

Chorus2:
After the war, will we still be the me same?
After the storm, will you remember my name?
After the dust
I can’t breathe anymore, I can’t sleep anymore

Bridge:
after the war.
Did you hear me
Did you hear me

Chorus3:
After the war, will it help me heal?
After the war, will you still be with me?
Blinded by blood, I can’t see anymore, I can’t hear anymore,
After the war.

Ending:
Will you still be with me?
Will you still be with me?
