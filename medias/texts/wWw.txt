I foresee the end of the world 
I see fire and death dancing in the sky 
Blood spits from the eye of the storm
women cry, Children burned, 
Chorus:
We Want War Set you up, take you down
Wild, Wild War Stand in line, kill them all  
Verse2:
I’ll promised you heaven and love
They say virgins for all your fucking sacrifice.
Only leaving violence and dust 
Will you get heaven and love? 
Chorus2:
We Want War Set you up take you down
Wild, Wild War Stand in line, kill them all  
Will it give heaven and love?
Bridge:
It won’t be long, my friend 
I’ll pour my wrath through your mouth
Ill spread death I’ll build an army of death 
From the mouths of serpents of doom Evil is born 
children cries melt in the wind of death 
The beast finally sends us the false prophet 
I’ll kill the light give you a god give you a guide to show us the right way  
Ending:
war War, No more  war, war not my war,   
war, Unholy war, unholy war, unholy war, 
this is the unholy war
