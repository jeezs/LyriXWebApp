Lies and liars
Are we dead or alive?
Verse:
Sell you powder, still your power,
Fuck your mind, shut your mouth
Buy your sex, smell like a flavor of love
From your blood, feed the dollar
Built from ashes, raise their empire from the oil found in the dirt
Chorus:
Reveal, the word, reveal reveal the world,
You’re the one, you're the one,
You're the one, tell te world what we want.
*
You!
Verse2:
Lust, expect the flavour
Love the shadow, hate the man.
The face iI see in the mirror
Is just the ghost of who I was
Chorus2:
Reveal, the word, reveal reveal the world,
You’re the one, you're the one,
You're the one, tell what do we want.
Verse3:
Lust, expect the power
Love the shadow, hate the man.
Hiding  pain  in the pleasure
Licking life until it sucks 
Chorus3:
Reveal, the word, reveal reveal the world,
You’re the one, you're the one,
You're the one, tell what do we want.
This is our last chance, our very last chance.
Bridge:
I’m your personal savior
your internal killer
Keep you safe, keep you sane
Protect your yourself  from danger
Protect yourself from yourself
from yourself, from yourself, Fuck yourself, Fuck yourself
Chorus3:
Reveal, reveal, reveal the word,
Reveal, reveal, reveal our world.
You’re the one, I’m the one,
we’re the one, we’re all that we want.
