Searching your hands lush by the rain
Water drops melted with tears
Fall on your face, onto your lips

after the storm.
What will left of us?
after the rain
Will you remember our names?
after the tears
after the war

Hidden into our own pain,
Screaming and praying for mercy
Wanna burn those pictures.
Reset our  mind
Help help

After the war, will we still be the me same?
After the storm, will you you remember my name?
After the dust
I can’t breathe anymore, I can’t sleep anymore

after the war.
Did you hear me
Did you hear me

After the war, will it help me heal?
After the war, will you still be with me?
Blinded by blood, I can’t see anymore, I can’t hear anymore,
After the war.

Will you still be with me?
Will you still be with me?
